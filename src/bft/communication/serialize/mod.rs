//! This module is responsible for serializing wire messages in `febft`.
//!
//! All relevant types transmitted over the wire are `serde` aware, if
//! this feature is enabled with `serialize_serde`. Slightly more exotic
//! serialization routines, for better throughput, can be utilized, such
//! as [Cap'n'Proto](https://capnproto.org/capnp-tool.html), but these are
//! expected to be implemented by the user.
